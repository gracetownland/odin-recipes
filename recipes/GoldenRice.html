    <h1>Golden Butter Rice</h1>
    <img src="goldenrice.png">
    <br>This golden butter rice, flavored with ginger and turmeric, is a forgotten way of cooking butter rice. It isn't cooked rice with butter stirred in, it really is rice cooked in butter. This is my favorite version, with seasonings inspired by a classic Indian drink called golden milk.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalteed butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 1/4 teaspoons ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>2 cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>3 cups water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>1/3 cup sliced green onions</li>
    </ul>
<br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt butter in a pan or pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium heat. As soon as butter starts to bubble, add in ginger, turmeric, cayenne, brown sugar, and salt. Cook, whisking, for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add rice, and stir until every grain is coated with butter. Stir in water, and bring to a boil over high heat. As soon as it begins to boil, gently shake and swirl the pan to settle rice into an even layer, then reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Cover tightly and simmer for 15 minutes. Turn off heat, and let rest, covered, for 10 minutes. DO NOT lift the lid or try to stir yet.</li>
        <li>Now, remove the lid and use a fork to fluff and separate rice grains. Season to taste, and serve immediately, garnished with walnuts and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
