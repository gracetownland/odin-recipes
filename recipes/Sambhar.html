<h2>How to make Sambhar</h2>
<br>Ingredients
<ul>
    <li> Tamarind</li>
    <li>Split Red Lentils</li>
    <li>2 types of veggies, preferably carrots and beans</li>
    <li>1 Onion</li>
    <li>1 Tomato</li>
    <li>Sambhar Powder</li>
    <li>Turmeric Powder</li>
    <li>Chilly Powder</li>
    <li>Mustard seeds</li>
    <li>Dried red Chilly</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
</ul>
<br> <h2>Steps to prepare Sambhar</h2>
<ol>
    <li> Step One: <p> Before we begin making sambar, it always helps to soak tamarind in water earlier. So soak 1 tablespoon tamarind in ⅓ cup hot water for 20 to 30 minutes.</p></li>
    <li>Step Two: <p>Once the tamarind gets soft, then squeeze the tamarind in the water itself. Discard the strained tamarind and keep the tamarind pulp aside.</p></li>
    <li> Step Three: <p>Rinse ½ cup tuvar dal (100 grams) a couple of times in fresh and clean water. You can use a strainer to rinse the lentils.</p></li>
    <li>Step Four: <p>Drain all the water and add the dal in a 2 litre stovetop pressure cooker. Also add ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder.<br> Note: You can also cook the lentils in a pan or instant pot. Add water as needed while cooking the lentils.</p></li>
    <li>Step Five: <p>Add 1.5 to 1.75 cups of water and mix to combine.</p></li>
    <li>Step Six: <p>Cover and pressure cook dal for 7 to 8 whistles or 9 to 10 minutes on medium heat.</p></li>
    <li>Step Seven: <p>When the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the dal. The dal should be completely cooked and mushy. Mash the dal with a spoon or wired whisk. Cover and keep aside. You can see the consistency of dal in the picture below.</p></li>
    <li>Step Eight: <p>When the dal is pressure cooking – rinse, peel and chop the vegetables. When making sambar, chop the vegetables which get cooked faster in large sizes like pumpkin, brinjals (small aubergines) okra, drumsticks etc.<br>Vegetables which take more time to cook are to be chopped in small sizes like carrots, potatoes, etc. I have chopped the pumpkin in large cubes and the carrots and potatoes in small cubes.<br>Chop the brinjals before you add them in the pan or else they darken. You will need 1 to 1.5 cup of chopped vegetables.<br>Note: For best taste and health reasons, I always make sambar with fresh vegetables. However you can use frozen vegetables also.</p> </li>
    <li>Step Nine: <p>Take 1 to 1.5 cups chopped vegetables in a pan or pot. Also add 6 to 7 pearl onions or 1 small to medium onion (thickly sliced) and 1 small to medium tomato (quartered).</p></li>
    <li>Step Ten: <p>Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder, ¼ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder and salt as per taste.<br>Adding kashmiri red chili powder is optional and can be skipped. I add it for a nice bright color in the sambar.</p></li>
    <li>Step Eleven: <p>Add 1.5 to 2 cups water and stir. Add enough water so that they cover the vegetables.</p></li>
    <li>Step Twelve: <p>Keep the pan on a stove top and begin to cook vegetables on a medium-low to medium heat. In between do check when the vegetables are cooking.</p></li>
    <li>Step Thirteen: <p>Cook till the vegetables are almost done. Ensure that you don’t overcook the vegetables.</p></li>
    <li>Step Fourteen: <p> Add the prepared tamarind pulp to the cooked vegetables. If you don’t have dried tamarind then use packaged or bottled tamarind paste.<br>You can add about ½ to 1 tablespoon of the tamarind paste or add as according to your taste. Mix this well</p></li>
    <li>Step Fifteen: <p>Add the mashed dal and mix well. Add water to balance consistency</p></li>
    <li>Step Sixteen: Temper <p>In a small pan or tadka pan, heat 2 tablespoons gingelly oil (oil made from raw sesame seeds).<br>You can even use sunflower oil, ghee or coconut oil instead. Add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds, and let it pop. Add 1-2 dried red chillies to this and 10-12 curry leaves. Fry mixture until chillies change color and add to Sambhar. Serve hot.</p></li>
